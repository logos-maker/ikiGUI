# ikiGUI
The smallest cross platform audio plugin GUI library availible. Is about 530 lines of code in total. With a minimum of dependencies, and uses only old standard system libraries for maximum compability.

Example code for using it can be found here... https://github.com/logos-maker/VST2

## GUI lib in C for iki graphics
It's a new cross platform audio plugin GUI library for tiled graphics with alpha channel and animations, that uses almost no code at all. 

It's currently availible to Windows and Linux, and selects the platform specific code automatically.

For displaying and animate graphics it uses simple placement, and character maps (an old concept widely used in the 80's and in 2D computer games that also gives the animation capabilities). 

And it's well suited for displaying prerendered skeuomorphic or flat vector graphics or photos as plugin graphics.

The core concept here is simplicity, and less is more. There is not much to learn, and it givs fewer compatibillity issues, and gives 100% identical graphis for all platforms.

The name is a wordplay with the Japanese words 'iki' and 'ikigai', combined with GUI (Graphical User Interface).

## Licences
The code will soon be dual-licensed for a small fee for closed source projects. More info later.
