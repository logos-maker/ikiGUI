# ikiGUI
The smallest cross platform audio plugin GUI library availible, that don't use any third party libraries.
- Can be used for making audio plugin GUI's.
- Cross compiles 100% identical code to Windows and Linux.
- 100% identical graphics for all supported platforms.
- It selects the platform specific code automatically.
- For self contained plugs, with no external files.
- Require no build system for compilation.
- It sets up a A8R8G8B8 framebuffer (also known as ARGB8888) for the entire plugin window.
- Uses 32bit pixels (24bit color and 8bit alpha channel).
- Can make precalculated compositing of images with transparancy.
- Super small code base
- Makes it easy to animate graphics.
- Makes it easy to make columns and rows of knobs, buttons or monospace letters.
- Can be used with C or C++
- Has compilation flag to strip away 100% of all platform depentant code.
    
Example code for using it making audio plugins can be found here... https://github.com/logos-maker/RST

## ikiGUI Graphics/GUI lib in C
It's a cross platform, graphics library for tiled graphics with alpha channel and animations, that uses almost no code at all. 

You can place graphic elements one by one or use character/tile maps (an old concept widely used in the 80's and in 2D computer games).
Tile maps it's a simple way to make columns and rows of knobs for example and animate them.

And it's well suited for displaying prerendered skeuomorphic or flat vector graphics or photos as plugin graphics, and gives 100% identical graphics for all platforms.

The name is a wordplay with the Japanese words 'iki' and 'ikigai', combined with GUI (Graphical User Interface).

## Reasons to use GUI lib for graphics
- Plugs that load and opens the editor incedibly fast.
- The small code base gives less bugs
- It's easy to understand and gain knowledge of what is actually happening.
- It's easy to modify
- It cross compiles with 100% identical code
- Easy to animate graphics
- Gives 24bit layered graphics with alpha channel

## What ikiGUI will do for you
- It lets you open audio plugin windows aka child windows.
- It gives you the mouse cursor position and buttons/knobs/tiles pressed (from your window object).
- It loads pictures that you embedd into your plugin (so your plugin is contained in one file).
- Lets you easily build layers of graphics with [alpha blending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_compositing),
built up of single graphical elements or arrays, rows and columns of pictures aka [tile maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_mode) (for example knobs for your audio plugin).
- It can give you information about what tile (for example a knob or button) the mouse cursor is on.

## Tutorial on how to prepare graphics for a plug with ikiGUI
For your plug you whant background graphics that you can think of as your front panel,
and some assets like knobs and other graphics that can change it's appearance during usage of your audio plug that will be on top of the background graphics. 

Your assets needs to be saved in a image format that supports alpha channel.
Alpha channel gives the possibility for transparent graphics for shadows and edges.
That will assure that your assets like knobs and switches on top of the background will look right.

One good place to find free suitable knobs for your plug is [here.](https://www.g200kg.com/en/webknobman/gallery.php)
On that page, click on one knob you like and then press 'Easy Rendering'.
On the next screen press 'Export Exec'.
Right click on the .png image in your web-browser and save it if it doesn't get downloaded automatically.

Next you need to convert the PNG image to a BMP file.
Open the image in a program and export the image to a BMP file using A8R8G8B8 formatting. After saving the image, you can convert it to a C-array that you can include in your project C code.
For conversion to a C-array, there is a program called asset_conv.c included in this repository if you don't have a program to do the job.

Then you also need a background image for your knobs to be displayed upon.
Use a external graphics program like Gimp or what you like to use.
And make your background color, text and everything you want visible on your front panel that has a static look.
It's good to make usage of layers when designing, so you can move and change separate things without problems. If you use layers, you can also try out your assets in the top layers in the graphics program.
The lib can also make image composition if you need to move stuff in your interface while developing.

Then when you are ready, you can then export it to a BMP image, all except your animated assets like knobs.
And then convert it to a c-array to include to your project, so your graphics will be embedded into your plug.

## Integrating other pixel based drawing routines
Maybe you want to be able to do other things with graphics that ikiGUI doesn't have out of the box.
Like drawing vector graphics, text or whatever.
This can quite easily be done, just get the base address for the pixels and the width and hight
of what you want to change and do what you need to do. All pixels are saved in a 32bit ARGB format.

If you want vector graphics maybe you could use something like...  
[Olive](https://github.com/tsoding/olive.c),  
[PlutoVG](https://github.com/sammycage/plutovg/tree/main)  
And here you can find a interesting video about image processing...

## What is a [tile map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_mode)?
A tile map is used to create a 2D grid of graphics. Examples of this is found everywhere in 80's computers and video games, and was used to display characters and build levels in computer games.
The tile map is stored in a array, where the first elements is the first row, followed by the second row and so on. And the first element is the upper left.
By changing the numbers in the array, you selects what graphical element to show in each position in the tile map. Historically this used built in graphics modes in the computers graphics chips.
And this tile map/character map told what character should be placed for every position of the intire screen.  

## How to create and make use of tile maps with ikiGUI
To have a place to put your graphics, need to define an object for a window. You simply do this by writing...
```
ikigui_window mywin ; // This will define an object called mywin. The name mywin is unique for your project.
```

Then you need graphics that you can use as a [texture atlas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texture_atlas)
And you need a place for storing that image. You do this by writing...
```
ikigui_image knob_anim; // knob_anim is the name of the array that is in the included file knob.h
```

Then you need to fill the ikigui_frame with graphics. For that we prepare a BMP picture converted to an array, and then include that in your program.
You include this by writing...
```
#include "gfx/knob.h" // gfx is the catalog and knob.h is the file with the array of the BMP picture.
```

Then you need to read in that BMP picture, and get itâ€™s width and hight. You do this by writing...
```
ikigui_bmp_include(&knob_anim,knob_array); // knob_array is the array found in knob.h
```

Then we need to have a tile map. You create one by writing...
```
ikigui_map knobs; // This will create a tile map called knobs. The name knobs is unique for your project.
```

Then we need to initialize that tile map with the graphical properties...
```
ikigui_map_init(&knobs, &mywin.frame,&knob_anim,0,0,0,64,56,5,1);
```
knobs is the tile map, 
mywin.frame is the destination, 
5 is the number of columns, 
1 is the number of rows,
64 is the width in pixels of each graphical object in the tile atlas,
56 is the hight if pixels of each graphical object in the tile atlas.
And 0,0,0, is an tile offset (that can be used for writing text) followed by is a custom y z distance between tiles in pixels if not set to zero.

To draw the tile map to the window you write...
```
ikigui_map_draw(&knobs,0,10,10);
```
knobs is the tile map, 
0 is the drawing mode, 
10 x coordinate where to paint it, 
the next 10 is the y coordinate.

Then finally to display this tilemap and everything else in your plug that you have drawn to the window. You do this by writing...
```
ikigui_update_window(&mywin); 
```
## How to display text for debugging
You can do this the same way that you can display arrays of knobs, you can make arrays of monospace characters.
The simplicity of this is useful for displaying numbers and messages in your editor window when developing.
It can be used in similar way thar character maps was used in computers in the 1970's an 80's.
The first part of the image should be space followed by ! and " in the same order as in the ASCII standard.
Then you can use the standard C lib to write text into your character map.
This can also be used for making tracker editors for sequencers.


## About the drawing modes of ikigui_map_draw()
It has 4 different drawing modes 0,1 and 2...
```
0. uses ikigui_blit_alpha() // Blits a part of an image, with alpha channel over the destination graphic
1. uses ikigui_blit_filled() // Blits a part of an image, with a background color so the destination graphic gets overwritten.
2. uses ikigui_blit_fast() // Blits a part of an image, without alpha channel.
3. uses ikigui_blit_hollow() // Blits a part of an image, with alpha channel overwiting the source color, but uses it's alpha information.
```
## Compilation
On linux it compiles with GCC, Clang or TCC. But to compile on Windows you need to install GCC with MinGW-w64. And there is many ways to do that, but I recommend to use [TDM-GCC](https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/articles/2021-05/10.3.0-release) as it's the simplest way to do it that I have found.
## Licences
The code will soon be dual-licensed for a small fee for closed source projects. More info later.
