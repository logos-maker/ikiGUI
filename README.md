cross platform audio plugin GUI library for tiled graphics and animations

## GUI lib in C for iki graphics
It's a new cross platform audio plugin GUI library for tiled graphics and animations, that uses almost no code at all. That is currently availible to Windows and Linux. 
It selects the platform specific code automatically, depending on what platform the compiler uses.
For displaying graphics it uses character maps, an old concept widely used in the 80's and in 2D computer games. But in this case you can place them anywhere in the editor window.
And is well suited for displaying prerendered skeuomorphic graphics or photos as plugin graphics.
